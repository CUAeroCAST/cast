Welcome to the CU Aerospace CAST team github.

When coding write primary scripts in the 'main' directory and call the importCast script
at the beginning to add all subdirectories to the path.

GIT GUIDELINES:

 Create an issue and a new branch for every feature.
 
 When completed with a feature generate a pull request, a code review will be completed
 within three (3) days and the code will be merged or returned for fixing. Code will fail
 review if it does not meet the coding guidelines below.
